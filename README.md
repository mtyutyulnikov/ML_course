# ML_course
Implementation of basic neural networks using numpy and cupy. DLCourse.ai structure of classes and layers was used.

Lab_2 - CNN (AlexNet 224*224) (has bugs with conv2d and maxpool implementations using numpy.lib.stride_tricks)

LeNet - CNN (LeNet 28*28) (no bugs, uses for loops)

Lab_3 - RNN and LSTM 

Lab_4 - MNIST GAN
