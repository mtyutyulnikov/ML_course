# ML_course
Implementation of basic neural networks using numpy and cupy. DLCourse.ai structure of classes and layers was used.

perceptron.ipynb - multilayer perceptron with numpy

LeNet - CNN (MNIST LeNet) (no bugs, uses for loops)

Lab3 - CNN (MNIST AlexNet) (has bugs with conv2d and maxpool implementations using numpy.lib.stride_tricks)

Lab_4 - RNN and LSTM (Steel_industry_data.csv)

Lab_5 - MNIST GAN
